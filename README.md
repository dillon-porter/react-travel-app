### React Travel App

Created a react app from module 1 from Bob Ziroll's - Learn React for Free on Scrimba (Updated 2021).
This was a solo project assignment from module #2, there was no coded solution for this project. 
We took a figma design and coded everything from scratch!

The Figma file can be found here: https://www.figma.com/file/QG4cOExkdbIbhSfWJhs2gs/Travel-Journal?node-id=0%3A1
